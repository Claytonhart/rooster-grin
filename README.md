### What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

I used React for this project, as it is what I am currently most comfortable with. Breaking the app into components allows for very modular UIs. I used react-slick for the slick carousel in the Hero and Tribute components, and react-reveal to allow each checkerboard component to fade in for 1000ms when scrolled to.

### Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

react-slick is a little tricky to make fully responsive with multiple elements in each section. The Tribute component starts with three cards shown and shrinks to two and one with more slides available as the page shrinks.

### What you enjoyed the most and why

I enjoyed seeing the finished product finally come together, I especially like the subtle animations that give the project a bit of personality, ex. The buttons move down, and their box shadows move in at the same time.

## Building

Create react app allows building and running this project locally easily with `npm start or yarn start`
